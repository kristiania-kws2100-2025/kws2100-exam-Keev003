We have made a soultion that refelcts tailor hazards and flood danger.
In the solution we have also added to showcase where different elemantary schools and railways are
according to the danger zones for landslides and floods. This is to give insights in
risk assessment and emergency planning.

We both worked on the exam, but on the background of water damage to one particpants PC we had to work from one PC.
It turned out to work quite easy considering we are roomates. That meant we could work with the project any time
of the day. We both sat through every step of the coding process. There were moments we worked alone.
We then used previous commits to see through and apporve of the changes to the project.
